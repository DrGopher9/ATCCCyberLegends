# Common Exploits & Vulnerabilities

**Know what the Red Team is throwing at you.**

## Windows Exploits
* **EternalBlue (MS17-010):**
    * *Target:* SMBv1 (Port 445).
    * *Fix:* Disable SMBv1 immediately. Patch Windows.
* **PrintNightmare:**
    * *Target:* Print Spooler Service.
    * *Fix:* Disable the Print Spooler on all Domain Controllers.
* **Mimikatz (Credential Dumping):**
    * *Target:* LSASS memory.
    * *Fix:* Enable "LSA Protection" in Registry. Don't log in as Domain Admin on infected boxes.

## Linux Exploits
* **DirtyCOW (Privilege Escalation):**
    * *Target:* Old Linux Kernels.
    * *Fix:* Update the kernel (`yum update kernel` or `apt upgrade`).
* **Path Manipulation:**
    * *Target:* User relying on relative paths.
    * *Fix:* Never run scripts as `./script`. Always use full paths `/home/user/script`.
* **Cron Job Persistence:**
    * *Target:* Hidden malicious tasks.
    * *Fix:* Audit `/etc/crontab` and `/var/spool/cron`.

## Web Exploits
* **SQL Injection:**
    * *Target:* Login forms (e.g., `' OR 1=1 --`).
    * *Fix:* Input validation (tough to fix in CCDC code, better to use a WAF/Firewall).
* **Web Shells:**
    * *Target:* PHP files uploaded to web directories.
    * *Fix:* Disable file uploads in `php.ini` (`file_uploads = Off`).
