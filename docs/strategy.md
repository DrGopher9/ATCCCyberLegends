# Scoring Strategy & Rules

**The Formula:** 50% Tech (Services) + 50% Business (Injects) = Win.

## 1. The "Open Source" Rule (CRITICAL)
* [cite_start]**Rule:** You CANNOT install "Free Trials" of commercial software (e.g., Norton, CrowdStrike Trial). [cite: 411]
* [cite_start]**Allowed:** Only "Free or Open Source" software. [cite: 410]
* **Safe List:** ClamAV, Notepad++, Wireshark, Putty, LibreOffice.

## 2. Scoring Breakdown
* [cite_start]**Services (35-50%):** Uptime of Web, Email, DNS. [cite: 464]
* [cite_start]**Injects (35-50%):** Business tasks submitted as PDF. [cite: 464]
    * *Strategy:* Assign one person as the "Inject Manager." Their ONLY job is to write PDFs and submit them. Never ignore an inject to fix a firewall.
* [cite_start]**Red Team/Incident Response (10-20%):** [cite: 464]
    * [cite_start]You get points for filing "Incident Reports" when you get hacked. [cite: 456]
    * Use the template in the `Common Injects` page.

## 3. "The Death Minute"
* [cite_start]**Rule:** "Teams should avoid submitting inject responses in the last minute." [cite: 134]
* **Strategy:** Submit 5 minutes early. The scoring server *will* lag.
